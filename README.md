I'm a swiss embedded electronics and software engineer. For over a decade, my passion for electrical engineering has been a constant companion. Starting in hardware development and gradually moving into almost exclusively software development, I still feel at home in both areas. In my free time, I engage with topics such as building automation, electromobility, and renewable energy.
